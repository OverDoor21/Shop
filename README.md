"Shop is my test project for Software Mind.
I hope that this project can showcase all of my strongest technical skills. I also look forward to discussing it with you.

Here is some information about the project: I have completed all the necessary tasks, such as:

Retrieving all products using the REST standard. There are two options: retrieving all products without any filters, and retrieving products filtered by name or price. Additionally, only sellers (admins) can add or delete products.
Implementing a system for bargaining, allowing clients to propose a slightly lower price for a product. However, the price cannot be reduced by more than half, and each product can only be bargained for three times. Sellers can either accept or decline the proposal.
Many methods related to creating bargains or products have been validated using FluentValidation.
Regarding the code:

I utilized dependency injection, making it easy to change or modify all controller methods within the services without any issues.
For data, I used SQLite, which provides a much easier way to save and work with all data. Additionally, you can find a method for paging all data within the Product Service.
Here are the packages and libraries used:

FluentValidation
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools"
